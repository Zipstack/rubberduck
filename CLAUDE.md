Remember that the basic idea for this project is in @idea.md, the spec is in @spec.md and the prompt plan, which serves as the implementation plan is in @prompt_plan.md. Always read these files to get a good idea about how the implementation is to be carried out. Also, remember that after the implementation, tests need to be written and run successfully before moving on to the next step. Once a step has been implemented, always mark it as done in the @prompt_plan.md file.

## Implementation Status

✅ **Automatic Proxy Restart on Startup**: Implemented application startup and shutdown event handlers that:
- Automatically restart any proxies that were left in "running" state when the application starts
- Gracefully stop all running proxies during application shutdown
- Update database status accordingly
- Provide comprehensive logging for debugging

To test this functionality:
1. Start a proxy using the UI or API
2. Restart the backend server
3. The proxy will automatically restart and be available on the same functionality

The startup logs will show: "Found X proxies that were left in running state" and "Successfully restarted proxy Y on port Z"

✅ **Multi-Provider Support**: Implemented support for all major LLM providers as specified:
- **OpenAI**: Full v1 API compatibility (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, etc.)
- **Anthropic**: Claude API support (`/messages`, `/complete`)
- **Azure OpenAI**: Deployment-based endpoints (`/openai/deployments/{deployment_id}/chat/completions`)
- **AWS Bedrock**: Model-specific invoke endpoints (`/model/{model_id}/invoke`)
- **Google Vertex AI**: Project-based endpoints (`/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/publishers/google/models/{model}:generateContent`)

Features:
- Auto-discovery and registration of provider modules
- Dynamic path parameter handling for provider-specific URLs
- Provider-specific error format transformation
- Request normalization for consistent caching across providers
- Authentication header passthrough (API keys, Bearer tokens, AWS signatures)
- Provider-specific icons in the UI

Each provider can be tested by:
1. Creating a proxy with the desired provider
2. Starting the proxy
3. Making requests to the appropriate endpoints with valid credentials

✅ **Real-time Dashboard**: Implemented comprehensive dashboard with live metrics and activity monitoring:
- **Live Metrics Updates**: Dashboard refreshes every 5 seconds with real data
- **Real-time Metrics**: Total proxies, running/stopped counts, cache hit rates, error rates, RPM, costs
- **Activity Feed**: Real-time stream of recent proxy activity (requests, cache hits, errors, etc.)
- **Time-based Calculations**: Metrics calculated from actual log data over last 24 hours
- **User-specific Data**: All metrics filtered by current user's proxies only

Backend Endpoints:
- `/dashboard/metrics` - Real-time metrics calculation from database
- `/dashboard/recent-activity` - Formatted recent log entries with smart event categorization

Frontend Features:
- 5-second polling for live updates
- Last updated timestamp display
- Error handling and loading states
- Real activity events instead of mock data
- Automatic proxy status reflection

Dashboard shows real metrics like:
- Cache hit rate: 35.7%
- Error rate: 50.0% 
- Total RPM: 14 requests in last hour
- Recent activity: "Cache hit", "Request completed", "Error 401", etc.
