Remember that the basic idea for this project is in @idea.md, the spec is in @spec.md and the prompt plan, which serves as the implementation plan is in @prompt_plan.md. Always read these files to get a good idea about how the implementation is to be carried out. Also, remember that after the implementation, tests need to be written and run successfully before moving on to the next step. Once a step has been implemented, always mark it as done in the @prompt_plan.md file.
